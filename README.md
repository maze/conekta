# Conekta wrapper for Go

This is a Go client package for the [Conekta][1] [REST API][2].

## Installation

Pull the package with `go get`, as usual.

```sh
go get github.com/maze/conekta
```

## Usage

Import the `github.com/maze/conekta` package.

```go
import (
	"https://github.com/maze/conekta"
)
```

Create a client using your account's API key.

```go
client := conekta.New(testKey)
```

Create a `*conekta.PaymentRequest` and fill it with payment info.

```go
payment := &conekta.PaymentRequest{
	Amount:      20000,
	Currency:    "mxn",
	ReferenceId: "000-stoogies",
	Description: "Stoogies",
	Card: &conekta.Card{
		Number:   "4111111111111111",
		ExpMonth: "12",
		ExpYear:  "2015",
		Name:     "Thomas Logan",
		CVC:      666,
		Address: &conekta.Address{
			Street1: "250 Alexis St",
			City:    "Red Deer",
			State:   "Alberta",
			Country: "Canada",
			Zip:     "T4N 0B8",
		},
	},
}
```

Pass the payment value you've just created to the conekta client.

```go
res, err := client.Charge(payment)
```

## Default client (single operations)

A default client is also provided with the package, so you can use API
calls as you would in single threaded Ruby or Python clients. If you're
planning to use multiple goroutines on calls you should use `*conekta.New()`
to create `*conekta.Conekta` clients for each goroutine instead.

```go
var res *conekta.PaymentResponse
var err error

conekta.SetAPIKey(`1tv5yJp3xnVZ7eK67m4h`)

res, err = conekta.Charge(payment)
```
